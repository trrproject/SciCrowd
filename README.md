# Overview

In a context where science and technology are rapidly advancing and robust solutions are needed to capture Triple Helix interactions within and across geographies, the exponential growth of scientific knowledge production remains an eminent challenge for researchers, institutions, policy-makers, funding agencies, and associated labs. The remarkable amount of R&D outputs published annually in conference proceedings, journals, and other dissemination channels has led researchers to spend less time with each paper and exclude relevant information sources to cope with specific needs. While the advances on large language models (LLMs) are being increasingly acknowledged worldwide, many challenges remain to be overcome when we transition from common sense reasoning to complex scientometric portraits characterized by volatile dynamics and heterogeneous semantic networks. Moreover, LLMs are reliant on the quality and availability of the foundational pre-trained data, resulting in problems like error propagation and hallucination. Thus, the SciCrowd project is established on the implementation of a socio-technical infrastructure able to store publication metadata classified by a crowd of users with the aim of enriching the quality of a co-evolving high-dimensional knowledge base using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). In this regard, SciCrowd is being developed 'from the ground up' as a mixed-initiative bibliometrically-enhanced information retrieval (IR) system built for (and by) researchers and the general public with the ultimate goal of conducting science and technology studies in a human-AI interactive fashion. The processes related with the analysis of basic requirements and functionalities’ specification according to functional requirements has contributed to the development of a prototype based on the mediation of the processes of scientometric output analysis, management of use levels and permissions, and data handling and visualization under different perspectives. Complementarily, a set of robustness tests and qualitative evaluations were performed to measure the system performance and end-users’ perceived usefulness and behavioral intents towards use.

# Project Description
