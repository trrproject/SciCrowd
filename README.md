# Overview

In a context in which the technology is developed at an increasing pace and where robust solutions are needed to fill social gaps and requirements continuosly evolving, the increasing number of scientific data can be considered an eminent challenge for institutions, researchers, research teams, associated labs, and general public. The remarkable amount of publications published annually in conference proceedings, journals, and other dissemination channels has led researchers to expend less time with each paper and exclude relevant information sources to cope with specific needs. In this sense, the SciCrowd project is established on the implementation of a socio-technical infrastructure able to store publication metadata classified by a crowd of users with the aim of enriching the current search engines and indexing mechanisms with an open semantic knowledge base of scientific metaknowledge mined from unstructured texts and other intellectual assets. In this regard, SciCrowd is being developed from the ground up as a mixed-initiative system built for (and by) researchers and the general public with the ultimate goal of conducting science and technology studies by means of hybrid collective intelligence. Initially, the system will support the field of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) due to its multidisciplinary nature and its associated challenges at a social and technological level. The processes related with the analysis of basic requirements and functionalities’ specification according to functional requirements support the development of a prototype based on the mediation of the processes of bibliographic information annotation, management of use levels and permissions, and data handling and visualization under different perspectives. Complementarily, a set of robustness tests were performed to measure the system performance.

# Project Description

SciCrowd is a crowd-powered system prototype that uses an open participation model in which a number of researchers, crowd members, and machines can act as "teammates" and contribute for improving the way as scientific data is processed.
